# Memo Log

MemoLog is an innovative note-taking and task management application that leverages the power of Jetpack Compose for a modern and intuitive user interface, and Room Database for robust and efficient local data storage. The app allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes and tasks seamlessly, ensuring all information is readily accessible and securely stored. One of MemoLog's standout features is its dynamic theming, which adapts to the system-wide Android theme, offering a consistent and visually appealing experience that matches the user's device settings. Looking ahead, we are excited to announce plans to integrate alarms and notifications, enhancing MemoLog's functionality by providing timely reminders and alerts to help users stay on top of their commitments and deadlines.
